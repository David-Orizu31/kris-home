        <h1 class="text-center text-blue text-kanit">Career Oppourtunities in Real Estate</h1>
        <h5 class="text-center text-manrope">Here are some Career oppourtunities that are available in Real Estate Management:</h5>

        <div class="career-item mt-4">
           <h4 class="text-kanit">1. Real estate managing broker</h4>
           <p class="text-grey">Being a real estate broker isn’t the same thing as being a real estate agent, even though the two terms are often informally used interchangeably. The difference between a broker and an agent is that a broker is a licensed real estate professional who has taken further education and is qualified to manage a real estate office with multiple agents. A real estate broker may be a career path to set your sights on if you’re already in the process of becoming an agent and want to know how your career could continue to grow. It’s one of the jobs that require a real estate license on this list, though not every job we have listed here does. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="career-item mt-3">
            <h4 class="text-kanit">2. Commercial real estate agent</h4>
            <p class="text-grey">It’s natural to think of residential agents when you talk about the real estate industry. After all, that’s what most of the real estate reality T.V. shows are about and you also don’t see images on the cover of the tabloids about which celebrity leased office space lately. However, commercial development can be as rewarding as residential and in some cases may suit your style and strengths even better.</p>
            <p class="text-grey">The day-to-day of a commercial real estate agent can include more research than that of a residential agent. A commercial agent helps businesses choose and secure locations that are going to boost their bottom line. While sometimes that means leasing great office space, other times it can be finding the perfect location for the next major coffee chain to build a store. For this reason, commercial agents often must put more emphasis on uncovering statistics and data about the area before they complete a transaction.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="career-item mt-4">
            <h4 class="text-kanit">3. Real estate investor</h4>
            <p class="text-grey">There are two different ways to be a real estate investor — active and passive. You can think of an active investor as your classic “house flipper.” This person would buy and flip residential properties or would support the work of another investor or contractor who is buying a property for resale. A passive investor is someone who puts money into a real estate project without having much involvement in the day-to-day management of a project. Even if you don’t have much money to invest, you can still become an investor in crowdfunded real estate investing. </p>
         </div>

         <div class="career-item mt-4">
            <h4 class="text-kanit">5. Commercial appraiser</h4>
            <p class="text-grey">Just like a residential appraiser, a commercial appraiser spends part of their day in the office and the other part of the day in the community assessing properties. While a residential appraiser may rely more heavily on what they learned during their licensing course, a commercial appraiser leans strongly on established appraisers to teach them how to determine the value of a property. Both disciplines require you to get licensed.  </p>
         </div>

         <div class="career-item mt-4">
            <h4 class="text-kanit">6. Property manager</h4>
            <p class="text-grey">When it comes to discovering what you can do with a real estate license, becoming a property manager is often a very appealing choice. A property manager is tasked with the responsibility of making sure a property — residential or commercial — runs smoothly and is, ultimately, making money for whoever owns it. When it comes to residential properties this could mean wearing many different hats such as leasing agent and repairman.</p>
            <p class="text-grey">Depending on the size of the property and the strengths of the property manager some or all of these tasks could be outsourced and the property manager’s role is simply to coordinate them and make sure the property is upkept. This is more common for commercial property managers.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="career-item mt-4">
            <h4 class="text-kanit">7. Leasing consultant</h4>
            <p class="text-grey">A leasing consultant’s job is to make sure there are tenants in the building. This job can often require you to work evenings and weekends, but a bonus is that it also usually comes with a degree of flexibility. If you enjoy marketing and negotiating this could be a great role for you. Leasing consultants need to get the word out about specials or openings in their building and often throw promotional events or enjoy staying up-to-date on the latest digital marketing best practices.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="career-item mt-4">
            <h4 class="text-kanit">8. Commercial leasing manager</h4>
            <p class="text-grey">Often assigned to office space or storefronts, a commercial leasing manager negotiates deals and transactions with businesses. A commercial leasing manager may have career opportunities that require them to keep a watchful eye on changes in the marketplace, as this impacts the budget businesses have for their various property needs.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="career-item mt-4">
            <h4 class="text-kanit">9. Foreclosure specialist</h4>
            <p class="text-grey">A foreclosure specialist can be employed by a bank or private lender and is responsible for all the documentation and processes that need to be followed when a property is being foreclosed on. They will review the client’s financial statements and process foreclosure cases so the property can be resold as quickly as possible. A foreclosure specialist needs to be organized and great with deadlines.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="career-item mt-4">
            <h4 class="text-kanit">10. Real estate attorney</h4>
            <p class="text-grey">If you love school and want to keep furthering your education beyond real estate, a career opportunity you may consider is becoming a real estate attorney. Real estate attorneys practice in many different areas. They could advocate for tenant rights or provide consul before a major real estate purchase.</p>
         </div>

         <div class="career-item mt-4">
            <h4 class="text-kanit">11. Corporate real estate manager</h4>
            <p class="text-grey">Companies often have openings for someone to come on staff and manage the real estate for the company. Large brands need to lease office space and commercial space. Some companies have real estate holdings that they need an in-house person to manage.</p>
